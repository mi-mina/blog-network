          would not be possible without the work of many people (vinyl collectors,
           music lovers...) who share old albums in their blogs. Most of the
           musical sources we use in our remixes come from there. In recent
           years we have been discovering and enjoying the richness and diversity
           of music through these blogs, and now we follow via RSS around 200 blogs.</p>
        <p>We've always imagined all these blogs as a sort of distributed archive,
           and we wanted to know how it might look like. The graph shows the
           blogs we follow and the relationships between them. If you hover the
           mouse cursor over a node you can see the blogs that follow this node.</p>
        <p>Unlike the orderly and centralized idea of archive associated with a
          cultural institution, this visualization shows a notion of distributed
          and decentralized archive. The access to an enormous musical richness
          (traditional and 20th century) of different parts of the world, is made
          possible thanks to this network, this ecosystem of music lovers.</p>
        <p>The fact that many blogs disappear or cease their activity, or that music
           is no longer accessible on the servers, gives this distributed archive
           a fragile, temporary, living character. What we see here is just a temporary image.</p>
        <p>We have long wanted to share all these fundamental sources for our project,
          and we think this is a good way. You can access the blogs by clicking on the nodes.</p>
